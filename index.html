            <p class="atari">
                For the first mini-game, we are planning to make a platformer game based around the idea of being able
                to identify strong and weak passwords. We are planning to make a game similar to Super Mario where the
                player moves across a world from left to right and jumps on platforms that have passwords written on
                them. If the player jumps on a platform with a strong password, they will land safely and be able to
                continue playing. If the player jumps on a platform with a weak password, the platform will break and
                the player will fall, causing the game to end. Players will get points based on how far they are able to
                go before falling and how many passwords they are able to identify as strong or weak.
            </p>
            <p class="atari">
                This game will include levels, where initial levels are quite easy (bad passwords are very obvious, like
                123456 or passw0rd, and good passwords are similarly easy to identify) progressing forwards to more
                challenging levels, including passwords based on personal identifying information, common English words,
                and more. The game will also include a continuous mode where there will be a similar difficulty
                progression but it will happen as the user continues forward to the right. The challenge here will be
                balancing the points so that users cannot run away on the leaderboard.

                This is a collection of Cyber Security based games with an emphasis on social competitiveness.
            </p>
            <p class="atari">
                The client envisions a game that can be played by his various customers, including UNC employees with
                departments from Facilities to Groundskeeping, with sensitive information to improve their habits
                online. A UNC onyen would be used to sign into the game and to link scores to an account. There are
                differences in knowledge among the future users of the game across departments and even in a department
                (e.g. a manager might have more experience online than someone in the field). One particular topic that
                was emphasized by the client was not trusting the internet and not clicking the links because they often
                install malware (spam identification). The client would like to discourage software installed games and
                prioritize non flash browser games. The game should preferably be compatible with tablets since there
                will be about 500 tablet-using faculty in the coming years. Finally, the client would also like us to
                prioritize competition, as this aspect would drive usage and therefore learning, and modularity, since
                there are many topics to teach and the game should be able to be handed to new developers for further
                improvement at the end of the semester.
            </p>
            <p class="atari">
                Our most important priority is to get the gamification of this project correct, since we want to keep
                our users to stay engaged enough to learn the information. As Dan said, "Make it pretty, make it
                interesting, make it businesslike."
